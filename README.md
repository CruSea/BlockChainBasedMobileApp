## Introduction 

Due to the fact that we peoples depend on our smart phones, now days most of us prefer to use the bible applications in our phones than the hard copy. Using bible applications has made our life easy, but on the other side we can not be sure if the version we are using is the original or not altered. 

So this project is a block chain based bible application in order to keep the **bible immutable & original** as it was in the ages of the apostles and early fathers.




It has an android application and a simple web interface. Also, we have developed a fake bible API for demonstration purpose.

### Technology
The Smart Contract is written with solidity. We used Web3 RPC to call the smart contract deployed on the Etherume network. 

The idea of this project is born in *#hackAddis_2018* hackathon. Since it is a hackathon project we did the parts as demo.
